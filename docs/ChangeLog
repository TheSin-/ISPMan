0.9.7
=====
        Many schema changes to work with openldap 2.1.x

	Changes to css, lookNFeel

	Resellers, Clients management. Although not finished.. Its on the
	right track

	Session logging feature. User can login, login and login and can
	still catch the same session and can commit it if previously forgot.

	cvs repository cleanup. It was a mess. To upgrade from older
	versions, you may want to run fixcvs script provided in the
	scripts directory

	Code cleanup. More command line scripts to automate jobs.
        
        Adding restrictions for admin to be able to delete a domain only
	if he has minimun 70 admin level
        
        Removed the DeleteDomain button from the menu bar.
        To delete a domain, click on edit domain and then click on the red
	button to delete a domain.
        
        Resellers, Clients wont be able to run getDomainInfo for any
	domain where they are not marked as Reseller or Admin
        
        Resellers, Clients will be blocked for performing admin functions
        Normally they don't have acces via the web interface, but one with 
        enough knowledge can pass URL Paramters. This will be now blocked.
        
        


0.9.1
=====
	Added a script to recreate the directories of domains/users/vhosts
        
        Making ISPMan::LDAP.pm more forgiving
        Don't complain when trying to add an entry that already exists.
        Log this error to error log and return quietly.

        Don't complain when trying to delete  an entry that does not exists.
        Log this error to error log and return quietly.
        
        Replaced ispman-agents hostname method.
	ispman-agent now uses Sys::Hostname to retrieve hostname

	Added a script ispman.myhostname to get hostname.

	Note For Developers: getEntry is changed/Fixed.
        It only gets the entry that you passed the DN for.
        It searches with scope "base" by default.
        If you want it to search with another scope you have to define it
	as the 4th param.
        $object->getEntry(DN, filter, [attribues], scope)
        
        Added a imapPort option for IMAP driver.
	This is useful if you are running your main imap servers on a
	different port and a proxy on the standard port. 

	Reworked ispman-agent a bit so it doesnt load ISPMan.pm on forking.
	It should load it only when the fork is done.
	This speeds up start/stop

	Adding again domain.replica.ldif.template
	This should fix the replica problems.
	
	Reworking a bit ispman.dnsset and adding verbose option
	Adding ispman.unset. This command takes the same arguments as 
	ispman.dnsset but removes the records instead of addming them

	Adding ispman.getConf . This script simply gets the value of an
	ispmanVar from LDAP. 
	This script is handy and also a starting point for people hacking
	ispman.

	Adding functions as_arrayref and as_array and using these instead
	of checking the type of value recieved every time. This should
	reduce possibilities of adding bugs.

	Adding functions to retrive the branch for the DNS records.
	This is useful if you want to delete the record and not leave an
	empty container behind

	Changing function newDNSRecord.
	If an entry exists, it should be left alone instead of a second
	value of record being added to 
	This change is neccessary since we are keeping each entry in its
	own branch/container 

	Unified modifyDomain from Primary/Slave/Replica/NoDNS.pm into
	genericModifyDomain in DomainMan.pm 
	So, less chances of errors again.

	Adding the folloing CLI utilities
		ispman.listSessions
		  This list sessions, and number of processes under that
		  session 

		ispman.commitSession
		  For those who forget to click on commitSession

		ispman.deleteSession
		  If a session and all processes under it should be deleted

		ispman.removeEmptySessions
		  This was added in 0.8 and mysteriously disappeared in 0.9

		ispman.listSessionProcesses
		  This utility lists the processes in the session
                  
		ispman.deleteHostGroup
		  This utility  to delete a host group from CLI
                
		ispman.addHost2HostGroup
		  This utility  to add a host to a hostgroup

                
		ispman.domainmail
		  This utility sends an email from a text file to users of
		  a domain 
		  It also accepts "all" as domain name and in that case
		  send to users of all domains 
		  Handy for notifications about system upgrades etc
		
		ispman.(list|add|delete)Admins
		  Lists|Adds|Deletes Admins

	        ispman.myhostname
                  tells you what the hostname is
                  This is the hostname returned by Sys::Hostname and this
	          name should be used for the hostname when adding host to
	          ispman

  

		ispman.makeDomainDirectories
		  (re)creates directories for domains/users/vhosts with
		  the correct permission 
		  perhaps usefull if you move the fileserver to another
		  machine.


0.9
===
	Removed apacheVhostsHeader and apacheVhostsFooter option

	Added Local Authentification for ISPMan Administrator panel
	remove htaccess.tmpl (no need of mod_ldap any more)
	This removes the headache I get when people cant get mod_ldap to work.
	Also there is speed benifit by using a local auth/session system.
	
	Added Logout option to ISPMan Administrator panel

	Added webHost and ISPManDomainDefaultWebHost attributes to the schema
	One can now choose which host the vhost should sit on.
	The hosts that are in the httpgroup must have a public IP address
	defined.

	Added logic to add an A record when creating Vhosts.
	Example: When adding a vhost called "www" for domain "ispman.org"
	on webhost "lweb1" an A record for "www" is create in the domain
	"ispman.org" pointing to the IP address of the webHost "lweb1"

	Vhosts now are in PosixAccout objectclass. Authentification is
	possible using vhostname and the associated password.

	ispmanControlPanelPassword removed. This was added with the
	scenario of a domain owner who wants to give FTP access to someone
	else (example a web design company) to manage a website, but don't
	want to give that entity total control over domain users, vhosts,
	dns etc. 
	Now this is solved by giving a userPassword to each vhost.
	So one can login using username: www.ispman.org and the password
	for that vhost.
	This would chroot the user to /path/to/domains/ispman.org/vhosts/wwww

	Added FTPStatus and FTPQuota for Domains, Users and Vhosts.
	Each entitity gets a quota and can be allowed or denied FTP access.
	
	Example, you have deny user "atif_ispman_org" ftp access but allow 
	"cypromis_ispman_org" to ftp.

	Currently the relation between the domain-owner and its children for
	Quota is not managed, but this will come soon on the front-end level.
	
	The Quota and ftpStatus requires pureftpd.
	Also added schema of pureftpd.

	ispman.dnsset: added possibility to add a dns record on all
	domains at once.

	Moved from mod_ldap settings to auth_ldap settings for Website ACLs
	Moved from mod_ldap to auth_ldap for control-panel authentification
	auth_ldap is avialable from http://www.rudedog.org/auth_ldap

	Ok, managed to get rid of auth_ldap for control-panel too.
	Both Admin panel and CustomerControl panel now work without
	mod_ldap or auth_ldap 


	Using mod_ldap_userdir for mapping /~username to vhosts
	mod_ldap_userdir is available at
	http://horde.net/~jwm/software/mod_ldap_userdir 



0.8
===
	Moved to ldapv3.
	Added prefix ispman. to all command line utilities
	Added MailGroups for distribution lists
	Added Session manager. No changes are sent to the server unless
	you commit the session via the web.interface 
	Added scripts to configure ispman variable from command line
	Added summary page that shows number of domains, users, vhosts etc
	Removed Netsaint code. will come back in 0.9
	Removed GlobalDNSVars. too many problems
	Added Admin manager. More than one admins can be setup to use ispman
	Added Domain Lock possibility. Admin X can lock domainY so other
	admins cannot change it 
	Added multiple dns backend scripts bind8(default) tinydns,
	bind9-sdbldap 
	Using dnszone schema

0.7.3
=====	
	Fixed reverse DNS bug in dns.lib
	DNS files are now cleanly kept in
	namedDirectory/namedIspmanDirectory/pri|sec|rev  etc 
	Added a script (bin/revips) . This will just list all the rev
	addresses that you have. Handy if you are not sitting on the DNS
	server. 
	SOA changes are back, you can change SOA per domain.
	Added a script  (scripts/upgrade_from_ldif.pl) that will come
	handy as we add stuf to ldifs. 


0.7
===
	New LookNFeel
	ControlPanel (for domain  customers)
	Groups (not yet working)
	Work on translating ControlPanel (Not yet ISPMan) is started. The
	control panel works in en, fr, de, nl already. 

	

0.6
===
	Major enhancements, such as 
	* larger part of configuration in the LDAP tree, modifying using
	the web frontend 
	* process management with host groups
	* Changed the conf and temp files location from /etc/ispman to
	$InstallDir 
	* IMPORTANT: Virtual hosts are moved from
		vhostDir/domain/ to vhostsDir/domain/vhosts
	So if you had your vhosts in for example
		/www/virtual/developer.ch/www
		/www/virtual/developer.ch/dev
		/www/virtual/developer.ch/ispman
		you will have to move them to 
		/www/virtual/developer.ch/vhosts/www
		/www/virtual/developer.ch/vhosts/dev
		/www/virtual/developer.ch/vhosts/ispman
	I know it will be difficult, but it makes it possible to have
	users home directories under the same domainRoot


	

0.4
===
	Changed ui so ISPMan is less pretty and more functional.
	Added Modules directory that contains correct modules that need to
	be installed 
	changes install.pl a bit, added install-modules.pl
	fixed install.pl so it build correct ldif file. there was a small
	bug that was adding a blank line in the middle of a record. 

0.3
===
	Minor changes, bug fixes


0.2
===
	Added commands adddomain adduser addvhost deletedomain deletevhost
	dnsshow 
	showdomains showusers
	These files can be found in INSTALLDIR/bin
	
	There was a bug in the install script that wasnt intalling 
	the Bundle. Hopefully have fixed it now.

	ldap2vhosts still not complete.


0.1
===
	initial public release.
	I know the code is dirty but its serving its purpose well for us
	and our 
	customers.
