Installing postfix from source:
--------------------------------

I use postfix-1.1.3
Please read README_FILES/LDAP_README from postfix distribution.

To install: I use
make tidy
make makefiles CCARGS="-I/usr/local/openldap2/include -DHAS_LDAP" \
        AUXLIBS="-L/usr/local/openldap/lib -lldap -llber"
make all install

Change /usr/local/openldap2/include and /usr/local/openldap2/lib to 
the path where you have ldap include files and library files

Once installed and configured for normal operations, see
install-data/examples/postfix_configuration/main.cf.dynamic
and
install-data/examples/postfix_configuration/main.cf.reasonable

As the name suggest, mail.cf.dynamic makes lookup for almost everything to ldap.
While main.cf.reasonable is more reasonable and only make lookups for things 
that change very often and for the rest it uses maps generated by ispman-agent


These are only example files to give you an idea. You should be able to 
configure and manage postfix to use them.
