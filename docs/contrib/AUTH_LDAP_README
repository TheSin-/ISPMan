About Installing Webservers for Customers.
-----------------------------------------
You can have one or more webservers installed.  When creating a vhost, you can
tell ispman which webserver it belongs to, this lets you distribute the load
across mulitple servers or distribute for other reasons. 

Example: you may want to put 
* customer who requires Oracle and jserver on
  a Solaris box with these features
* customers who require PHP on a Linux box
* some friends (non-paying customers) on an old Indy
etc
etc


For the customer webservers which your client will access,
you may need to have auth_ldap compiled in as a module.

Auth_ldap is a module that provides authentification services by looking
up information in the LDAP directory.
This module is only needed if you wish to use the Access control feature of
the customer control panel.

You can download auth_ldap from its homepage
http://www.rudedog.org/auth_ldap

You don't need to recompile your Apache server if it is compiled with loadable 
modules support

To check if you Apache binary is compiled with loadable module support
run

/path/to/your/httpd -l

look for mod_so.c in the result. If you see it, then your server supports
loadable modules.

For help on building the auth_ldap module see
http://www.rudedog.org/auth_ldap/1.6/auth_ldap.html#building

I normally compile with
./configure --activate --with-ldap-sdk=openldap --with-apxs=/path/to/apxs
make all install


You will be prompted for a username/pass
The username is the same as you set for the admin
example, if you set
uid=ispman, ou=ispman, o=ispman

then the username is "ispman"
and the password that you set for the admin
