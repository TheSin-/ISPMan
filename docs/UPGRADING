Upgrade ISPMan from earlier version
===================================

Note:   Depending on which ispman version you are running, the
        following may work more or less smooth for you.
        If you encounter any trouble, please report any errors together with
        as much information you have to
        ispman-developers@lists.sourceforge.net, so we can improve the
        upgrade process.


Disclaimer:
Upgrading is a delicate process which can harm your data. Be sure to
have a recent backup to recover your installation. If possible try
upgrading on a testsystem first.



Preparation
===========
Updated ISPMan versions may come with modified LDAP schema, which
makes it necessary to migrate the data.

Thus, you should dump your existing ISPMan data to some temporary LDIF
file:
        -> <installdir>/bin/ispman.ldifdump > /tmp/myispman.ldif

You may want to save this file to a more save location also for backup
purposes.


Next, the <installdir> has to be cleaned, so we get rid of any files,
that are not contained in the updated version anymore.
Best way to do this is to remove all subdirs except the conf
directory, but be aware that this will remove any customization you
have made to ISPMan files.



Update ISPMan files
===================

Do the normal ISPMan install after you acquired the update via tarball or
cvs (see INSTALL for more info):

So this will be something like
        -> ./configure --prefix=<installdir>
        -> make clean
        -> make
        -> make install

Besides the updated ISPMan files, the following important things get
installed:

<installdir>/conf/ispman.conf.example
        A new default example for ispman.conf

<installdir>/conf/ldif/ispman.ldif:
        This is the basic LDAP DIT for ispman.
        Though, most of this should already exist in your LDAP, it may
        contain additional entries (e.g. confVars) that are not
        present yet.

<installdir>/conf/schema/*:
        Updated schema files.

Now check your (old) ispman.conf and update any missing or changed
entries from ispman.conf.example.



Migrate your LDAP data
======================
With all ISPMan files in place you can execute "<installdir>/bin/ispman.ldifupdate"
to check consistency of your LDAP data
        -> <installdir>/bin/ispman.ldifupdate -o /tmp/changes.ldif

This reads ISPMan data from your LDAP server and checks it against some
migration/validity rules.
You will be informed about any necessary changes, which will be
written in LDIF format to the sepcified output file (-o). 

Keep that file for now, until you completed the next two steps.


Apply config/schema changes
===========================
The install/upgrade process doesn't touch your existing ispman.conf,
but comes with a new ispman.conf.example file.
Make sure your ispman.conf contains the same config keys as the example.

Next update your LDAP schemas. In case your OpenLDAP doesn't use the
schemas directly from <installdir>/conf/schema, make sure to copy the
updated files to OpenLDAP's schema directory.

Check that your slapd.conf contains at least the following schemas:
        core.schema
        cosine.schema
        nis.schema
        misc.schema
        inetorgperson.schema
        dnszone.schema
        proftpd.schema
        ispman.schema


Once your slapd.conf is ok and all schema's are included, restart your
ldap server. Make sure that the ldap server started ok. If it doesn't
start or give errors, try to see what is wrong and don't continue
unless you fix the problems.


Preparing Perl modules
======================
ISPMan versions up to 1.2 came with all needed perl modules bundled
into the installation. Starting with 1.3 those dependant modules are
still bundled with ISPMan, but not installed on default anymore, giving
you the choice of using the bundled modules, or the ones provided by
your system.

Please note that we provide the perl modules for reference purposes,
to make problems/bugs reproducible.
So, if you are running into some trouble with ISPMan, please reproduce
your problem with the bundled perl libs first and see if it persists.

See the INSTALL doc (section 3) for your options and more information
on how to install the bundled perl modules.


Import new ISPMan data
======================

Now you should be able to load the generated LDIF file from above to 
the LDAP server with
	-> <installdir>/bin/ispman.ldifload -f /tmp/changed.ldif

Please report any problems you have with running ispman.ldifupdate as the quality
of logic greatly depends on users feedback.

If that worked out ok, you should be ready to go.

Please send any bugs or improvement suggestions to
ispman-developers@list.sourceforge.net
