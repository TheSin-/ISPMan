1 - Introductory Comment
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Currently, ISPMan uses the mailRoutingAddress to route mail arround for
several mailstores. So username@domain.tld get's tranlated to
username_domain_tld@cyrus_mailstore_backend.

My problem with this approach is that user would have to login to POP/IMAP
like username_domain_tld unless an IMAP/POP proxy was in the middle to do the
needed translation from username@domain.tld to username_domain_tld.

The mailRoutingAddress now just becomes the normal email address of the user,
ie, username@domain.tld.


1.1 - Cyrus & Saslauthd
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
To support this new behaviour, one must set cyrus `virtdomains` setting to
`userid` or `on`(I'm using userid), `unixhierarchysep` to `yes` and also pass
the `-r` flag allong with all other's you already passed to saslauthd init
script.

In `imap.conf` you must also set `lmtp_admins` with `cyrus` in it. This cyrus
user is the one we've setup in `ispman.conf`, so set it to the one you've set
in `ispman.conf` if you changed that. This is for all cyrus mailstores you
have.


1.2 - Postfix
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The needed changes of postfix from the old behaviour are that every domain we
hanlde will be relayed wether it is set to deliver localy or trough smtp.

No more `virtual_alias_domains` because with this setting we're promissing
postfix that we're gonna re-write the address for a domain listed there, and
we're not doin't that. Instead, every domain we host will be in
`relay_domains`.

The `relay_recipient_maps` will have all the addresses meant to be handled
localy(ie, not forwarded).

The `virtual_alias_maps` will only be used to handle mail forwards.

The `tranport_maps` will become the heart of this setup. It will be used to
let postfix know how to relay. We're gonna use lmtp for that.

All ldap-* and `main.cf` example files can be found on the ISPMan source
under `install-data/examples/postfix_configuration/with_cyrus_virtdomains/`



2 - Final Thought's
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Although a user is now able to login into IMAP/POP, with username@domain.tld,
in order to be able to fetch the correct mailbox from the correct cyrus
mailstore, an IMAP/POP proxy is still needed, unless we setup cyrus murder,
or we use only one cyrus mailstore.


2.1 - Perdition
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
With perdition CVS(1.17 has a bug in the ldap code), one is able to solve the
problem I said earlier, ie, we use perdition to proxy for the several cyrus
backends.

Perdition queries the ldap database for the user logging in and returns the
mailHost, which then uses to know where to proxy to.

And example `perdition.conf` snippet is also found under
`install-data/examples/postfix_configuration/with_cyrus_virtdomains/`

And that's all there's needed to solve the final problem with this kind of
setup :)

Of course on perdition.conf you might use other options with these, I did,
specially the debuging parts, and so should you when testing, but, these are
the real important settings.
