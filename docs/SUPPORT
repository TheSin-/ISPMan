ISPMan Support
==============

As explained in INSTALL, bug fixes are available only through cvs.  Read
through INSTALL and UPGRADING to learn how to upgrade.  Incremental bug-fix
upgrades are very easy and painless.

There are a variety of options for technical support. 

1) Search the online archives.  

There are technical forums that although are not necessarily monitored
regularly, do occasionally contain useful information:
    http://sourceforge.net/forum/?group_id=8390

The mailing list archives are the most active.  Search through ispman-users
first, then ispman-developers for your answer.
    http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum=ispman-users
    http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum=ispman-developers

2) Join the ispman-users mailing list.

Subscribe to ispman-users and ask your question there.  If it hasn't been
answered in the archives, this is your best bet for free help.  The
ispman-developers list is for discussions on the design and implmentation of
ispman and not for technical support.  Most of us are subscribed to
ispman-users anyway, so ask there.

3) Log into the IRC chat channel #ispman at irc.freenode.net.

You may find users and developers logged in there occasionally.  I did when I
needed it while learning about ISPMan.  Now I'm a developer.

4) Hire an ISPMan support firm.

Support firms are available that can provide you with commercial support for
ISPMan and other isp design, implementation and related services.  These
options include training, fixes, implementation of new features and
maintenance.  Companies are available by remote and in various locations in the
USA, and Europe.
