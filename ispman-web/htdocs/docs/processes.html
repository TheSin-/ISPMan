<tr><td>ISPMan schedules system changes using processes. Processes are
directed to hosts based on hostgroup membership. 
<tr><td>You can view the Processes
"in the queue" by clicking on the Processes tab at the top of the screen.
<br><img src="images/processes.png">
<tr><td>A process can have the status of "new" or "insession". 
<ul><li>insession - the process is waiting for the user to click "Commit
session". Clicking Commit session changes the state to new.
<li>new - the process is waiting for the ispman-agent to execute it.
</ul>
<tr><td>If the user logs out before clicking "Commit session" the process
will stay in the "insession" status until it is manually deleted or manually
changed to the "new" status.
