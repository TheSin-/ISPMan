<h1>INSTALLING APACHE FOR ISPMan.</h2>
<hr>

ISPMan runs best with mod_perl.
<br>
You can run it with your webserver that is serving other stuff, but I prefer to run a separate server for ISPMan.

<p align=justify>
You can run without mod_perl but the speed will not be so good, since ISPMan will have to make a connection to the LDAP server and create the objects each time you load any page.
</p>

<p align=justify>
ISPMan also requires some way of authentication for users.
It will not work properly unless a user is authentified and a $ENV{'REMOTE_USER'} is set.
I use mod_ldap.1.8.c for authentification and I will explain in the rest of the document on how to set that up.

<p align=justify>
Create a build directory.<BR>
/opt/ispman/build <BR>
(I like the keep the sources and the build even on production machines so that I can make a change if I want to quickly rather than looking for sources and remembering what I did before to get this software compiled)
<BR>

cd to that directory.
<BR>


<p align=justify>
You may obtain the sources either from a mirror or from the links provided.
<BR>obtain sources of apache from http://httpd.apache.org/dist/apache_1.3.14.tar.gz
<BR>obtain sources of mod_perl from CPAN  http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/DOUGM/mod_perl-1.24_01.tar.gz
<BR>obtain mod_ldap.c from http://www.kie.berkeley.edu/people/jmorrow/mod_ldap/mod_ldap.1.8.c.tar.gz
<BR>
<BR>untar all files.
<BR>
<BR>rename apache-1.3.xx to apache
<BR>rename mod_perl-1.24.xx to mod_perl
<BR>rename mod_ldap.1.8.c to mod_ldap.c
<BR>
<BR>move mod_ldap.c to apache_1.3.14/src/modules/extra directory
<BR>
<BR>copy the Makefile.ISPMan.apache to Makefile in /opt/ispman/build
<BR>cp Makefile.ISPMan.apache /opt/ispman/build/Makefile
<BR>EDIT the Makefile if neccessary
<BR>
<BR>cd to /opt/ispman/build and run 
<BR>make all
<BR>
<BR>this should build apache with mod_perl and mod_ldap for you.
<BR>
<BR>For more information see the <A HREF="Makefile.ISPMan.apache">Makefile</a>
