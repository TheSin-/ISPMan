<tr><td class=menuheader>Adding a virtualhost or website</td>

<tr><td>Adding a virtualhost is straightforward. 
<ul><li>Select the domain to manage</li>
<li>Under "Manage virtualhosts" click Add virtualhost.</li> 
<li>A box pops up, type "www" two times with no quotes.</li>
<li>Set virtualhost aliases to these 2 lines (changing the domain name)
<br>customer.com
<br>*.customer.com</li></ul>
<tr><td>These aliases tell the webserver to always serve the website files at: 
/ispman/domains/customer.com/vhosts/www/htdocs 
<tr><td>NOTE: If you have multiple virtualhosts/websites, don't use *.customer.com
as an apache alias, use simply www.customer.com.  Using *.customer.com may
block access to the second virtual host.
<ul><li>Make sure "FTP Access" is enabled, and set an "FTP password". This is
also the password to the customer control panel.</li>
<li>Click the "Update" button.
<li>Be sure to click "Commit session" when done.
</li>
</ul>
<tr><td>ADVANCED TIP: To add a second virtualhost, like private.customer.com, use
the above steps, but at step 3, type private twice. Your ftp server would be
private.customer.com and FTP username would be private.customer.com.
<tr><td class=menuheader>FTP Upload Information</td>
<tr><td><b>FTP server</b> The hostname of the virtualhost. If you were
editing www.customer.com, the FTP server would be www.customer.com.   
<tr><td><b>username</b> The full name of the virtualhost. If you were 
editing www.customer.com, the username would be www.customer.com.
<tr><td><b>password</b> Whatever you set above.
<tr><td>The website files should be uploaded to the htdocs folder.
