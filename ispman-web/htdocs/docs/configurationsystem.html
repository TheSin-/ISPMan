administrator's email address, installaion directory, and password hashing
methods.

<tr><td><b>Understanding Password Hash Methods</b>
The hash method used must balance the protocols, authentication types, and
need for security. Hashing creates a long string of numbers based on the
password. This long string of numbers is called the hash. It is considered one way, 
since is is nearly impossible (if not impossible) to tell what the original 
password is from the hash.
<ul><li>clear - not a hash method. Stores the password string in base64 in LDAP, easily
viewable. Required for SMTP AUTH using LOGIN.
<li>crypt - standard unix crypt hash
<li>md5 - 128-bit hash, stronger than crypt 
<li>sha - 160-bit hash, stronger than md5, but slower
</ul>
