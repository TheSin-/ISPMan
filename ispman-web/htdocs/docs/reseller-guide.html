<tr><td>Welcome to ISPMan! As a reseller, you can easily add clients and
domains for your clients. 
<tr><td>ISPMan allows your clients have their own login to
the ISPMan system. Logging in allows your client to manage their own
email accounts and virtualhosting. Of course, you can fully administer their domains if they have a problem or
a question.
