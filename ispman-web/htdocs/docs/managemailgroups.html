<tr><td>Mailgroups are like a very simple mailing list, or distribution
email list. They are commonly
used to provide a group of users an easy way to email everyone. 
<tr><td>They can
also be used to redirect "role" accounts to the appropriate people. For
instance, many companies have an "info@" account. If you make an info
mailgroup, you can forward any emails sent to info@ to several staff
members.
<tr><td>Say your company has 2 salespeople and the owner would like to have any
emails coming in to sales@customer.com to go to alice, bob and himself.
Here's how to set that up.
<li>Create a new mailgroup by clicking "Add mailgroup"
<li>For the "Mail group name" field enter sales 
<li>For the "Mail group members" enter: 
<BR>alice@customer.com
<BR>bob@customer.com
<BR>ceo@customer.com
<li>Click the "Add Mailgroup" button. To activate your change, click "Commit
Session".
<tr><td>If you wanted any emails to sales OR info go to this same list of
people, add info@customer.com to the "Mail group aliases"
