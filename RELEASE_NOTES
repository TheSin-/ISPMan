ISPMAN (Version 1.4) Release Notes - January 2009
--------------------------------------------------
After a quite long phase of CVS provided updates and several release candidates, the final 


Supported components
---------------------
Core ISPMan:
* LDAP v3 Server (preferably OpenLDAP, Sun DS or OpenDS)
* Perl >=5.8
* Apache 1/2 with Perl (embedded/CGI) support

Managed Components:
* PADL libnss/pam LDAP Service
* Apache 1/2
* Postfix
* Bind (v8,v9) DNS
* Cyrus IMAPD or Courier Mailstore
* PureFTPD / ProFTPD
* MySQL

Optional Components:
* Horde Framework
* Amavis/Spamassassin
* (basically any LDAP-aware application)


Compatibility with other components & Customizations
-----------------------------------------------------
All ISPMan configuration is stored in LDAP. Thus any application that is capable of using this configuration data directly can be attach to this architecture. However, most of server applications still require text based configuration files, which need to be generated by ISPMan agent.
Component libraries serve this requirement that can be replaced/extended with alternate versions to support other software applications.

Webserver:
The web server configuration (VHosts) is generated by "lib/http.lib". Replacing the key Perl methods with different logic allows adjustments for other web server products.

Mailstore:
Component libraries for Cyrus (lib/mailbox_actions_cyrus.lib) as well as Courier (lib/mailbox_actions_courier.lib) are provided. For other mailstore products a matching library needs to be provided that takes care of mailbox handling.

DNS:
A library is provided for Bind v8,v9. 

Database:
MySQL is the primary supported database and implemented by "lib/database.MySQL.lib". Stubs for Postgres and Oracle are provided.


Clean Install
--------------
see docs/INSTALL

For users on Debian Linux, ISPMan comes with a debian packaging subtree. So running something like "debuild" on your extracted ispman dir will build you some nice DEB packages which can be installed very nicely.


Upgrade from previous versions
-------------------------------
For general upgrade instructions see docs/UPGRADING.

Several new configuration options and LDAP schema modifications have been applied to ISPMan v1.4, which may be incompatible with your current setup.
As described in the UPGRADING notes, you shall use ispman.ldifupdate to compare your online ISPMan LDAP repository to the new required LDAP entries. Besides that it will detect potential errors in your current data and generate a LDIF file with all necessary modifications.

Amavis Schema:
The "amavis*" attributes were removed from the ispmanDomainUser objectclass. They were not used by ISPMan itself and merging them with ispmanDomainUser was bad design anyhow.
If you have used them with your own ISPMan modifications, please note the newly added schema file "amavis.schema", which contains *all* Amavis LDAP attributes as well as the auxiliary objectclass "amavisAccount".
Add this objectclass to your $Config->{'ispmanUserObjectclasses'} in ispman.conf and run ispman.ldifupdate.


Using LDAP Servers other that OpenLDAP
---------------------------------------
ISPMan should run with any LDAP v3 compliant server, like Sun Directory Server, OpenDS, etc.
Due to the different design, the provided schema files may not work with the particular LDAP server, as they require different schema formats. To convert the generated and bundled schema files to a LDIF based format, you may use the script "scripts/schema2ldif.pl" or other schema converters of your choice.


New Features
-------------
Several new features and tons of bugfixes have been added to ISPMan v1.4.
The most significant new features are:

Webserver Virtual Hosts:
